// MARK: Question 1

///
/// PURPOSE:
/// Create a base class called Vehicle that inherits from NSObject
/// Vehicle must provide an initializer that takes an unsigned integer called maxFuel
/// maxFuel indicates the maximum amount of fuel (e.g., in litres) that  the vehicle can contain
///
/// Create a base class called Terrain that inherits from NSObject
/// Terrain must provide an initializer that takes an unsigned integer called fuelConsumption
/// fuelConsumption indicates the amount of fuel (e.g., in litres) that is consumed while travelling over the Terrain
///
/// Add a move method to Vehicle that takes an instance of the Terrain class
/// If moving over the current Terrain would result in the remaining amount of fuel in the Vehicle to go below 0, the move method must throw a QuizError.OutOfFuel(fuel amount of current Terrain) error
/// Otherwise, the current Terrain is added to the list of Terrains loaded so far
/// Make sure to add a terrains variable to track all Terrains over which the Vehicle will move
///
enum QuizError : Error {
    case OutOfFuel(fuel: UInt)

        }
        maxFuel -= terrain.fuelConsumption
